# Comparative Study of SDLC Models and Requirements Management

##  Project Title
Comparative Analysis of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Models and Their Impact on Requirements Engineering

---

##  Project Description

This project presents a detailed comparative study of three major Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models — Waterfall, Incremental Development, and Spiral Model — using a large-scale E-Commerce System as a case study.

The report evaluates how each model influences requirements management, risk handling, change adaptability, time constraints, and cost considerations. A simplified Requirements Engineering document and validation strategy are also developed to demonstrate practical application.

##  Objectives

- To analyze the characteristics of Waterfall, Incremental, and Spiral models  
- To compare their suitability for large-scale systems  
- To evaluate their impact on functional and non-functional requirements  
- To design a simplified Software Requirements Specification (SRS)  
- To propose a requirements validation strategy  

---

##  Case Study: E-Commerce System

The selected system represents a real-world large-scale application involving:

- User Registration and Authentication  
- Product Browsing and Search  
- Shopping Cart and Order Processing  
- Secure Payment Integration  
- Inventory Management  
- Admin Dashboard  
- Scalability and Security Requirements

##  SDLC Models Compared

### 1. Waterfall Model
- Linear and sequential development approach  
- Best suited for stable and clearly defined requirements  
- Limited flexibility for requirement changes  

### 2. Incremental Development Model
- Development in multiple smaller releases  
- Continuous feedback and gradual requirement refinement  
- Better adaptability to evolving requirements  

### 3. Spiral Model
- Risk-driven and iterative approach  
- Emphasizes risk assessment and stakeholder validation  
- Suitable for complex and high-risk systems

##  Requirements Engineering

The repository includes:

- Initial Functional Requirements  
- Refined Functional Requirements  
- Initial Non-Functional Requirements  
- Measurable and Validated Non-Functional Requirements  
- Requirements Validation Strategy  
- Risk and Change Management Analysis  

---

##  Evaluation Criteria

The SDLC models are compared based on:

- Functional Requirements Management  
- Non-Functional Requirement Handling  
- Risk Assessment Capability  
- Change Management Flexibility  
- Time Constraints  
- Cost Implications
